        <h1>Mozzarella Stick Recipe</h1>
        <p>Mozzarella sticks have always held a special place in my heart, reminding me of cozy family gatherings and joyful, laughter-filled parties with friends. 
        My fascination with them began in my grandmother's kitchen, where she skillfully turned simple ingredients into culinary magic. 
        Inspired by her, I crafted my own recipe, enhancing the traditional snack with a few personal touches that elevate its flavors and textures.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>12 sticks of mozzarella cheese (<em>preferably whole milk mozzarella for creaminess</em>)</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
                <li>2 cups Italian seasoned breadcrumbs (<em>for that extra herby flavor</em>)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (<em>adds a nice depth</em>)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder (<em>for a kick of garlic</em>)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Optional for serving:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Marianara sauce</li>
                <li>Ranch dressing</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Equipment:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Deep fryer or large heavy-bottomed pot</li>
                <li>Paper towels for draining</li>
                <li>Three shallow bowls</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by cutting the mozzarella into sticks if you haven’t bought pre-cut sticks.
                Freeze the sticks for at least two hours. This helps them hold their shape while frying.</li>
                <li>In the first bowl, mix the flour with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>In the second bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together until well combined.</li>
                <li>In the third bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan, garlic powder, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Roll each frozen mozzarella stick in the flour and shake off excess.</li>
                <li>Dip into the egg wash, then roll in the breadcrumb mixture. Press to coat well.</li>
                <li>For extra crispiness, double dip the sticks by repeating the egg wash and breadcrumb steps.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in your deep fryer or pot to 375°F (190°C). Fry the mozzarella sticks in batches, careful not to overcrowd the pot, until golden brown and crispy, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with bowls of marinara sauce and ranch dressing for dipping.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Personal Touch:</h2>
            <p>My grandmother always said that cooking isn't just about following a recipe—it's about putting a piece of your heart into the food. 
            That’s why I like to add a sprinkle of love (and extra Parmesan!) when serving. 
            These mozzarella sticks are more than just a snack; they're a warm reminder of my heritage and the joys of sharing good food with loved ones.</p>
            <p>Enjoy making and eating these mozzarella sticks, and may they bring as much joy to your gatherings as they have to mine!</p>
