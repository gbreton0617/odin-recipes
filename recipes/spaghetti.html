        <h1>Spaghetti Recipe</h1>
        <p>Spaghetti has a special story in my life, weaving through memories of both simple weeknight dinners and festive occasions. 
        My love for this classic dish was ignited during my college years, when I spent a semester abroad in Italy. 
        There, under the tutelage of a kind-hearted local chef named Giulia, I learned not just to cook, but to celebrate the art of Italian cuisine. 
        Inspired by her passion and the vibrant local ingredients, I've honed a spaghetti recipe that captures the essence of those days, with a few personal twists that bring out the richness and depth of the flavors.</p>
        <h2>Ingerdients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef (<em>optional, can be substituted with ground turkey for a lighter version</em>)</li>
            <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red wine (<em>a good quality that you would drink</em>)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar (<em>helps balance the acidity of the tomatoes</em></li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh basil, chopped (<em>for garnish</em>)
            </li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (<em>for serving</em>)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Equipment:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Large pot for boiling pasta</li>
            <li>Large skillet or saucepan</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. 
            Drain and set aside, reserving a cup of the pasta water to thin the sauce if necessary.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            Add the onion and garlic, saut√©ing until they are soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>If using meat, add the ground beef to the skillet and brown it, breaking it up with a spoon, until it is fully cooked and no pink remains.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, red wine, sugar, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. 
            Bring to a simmer and let the sauce cook, uncovered, for about 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
            If the sauce gets too thick, thin it with a little reserved pasta water.</li>
            <li>Toss the cooked spaghetti with the sauce, ensuring all the noodles are well coated. 
            Let it simmer together for a few minutes to let the flavors meld.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil and a generous sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
          </ol>
        <h2>Personal Touch:</h2>
          <p>Giulia always emphasized the importance of using fresh, high-quality ingredients and taking the time to let the sauce simmer to develop its full flavor. 
          She also taught me the value of sitting down and enjoying the meal with others, turning a simple dish of spaghetti into a celebration of connections and shared experiences.</p>
          <p>I hope this recipe brings a touch of Italian warmth to your table, reminiscent of those golden afternoons in Giulia's kitchen, surrounded by laughter and the comforting sounds of simmering sauce and boiling pasta.</p>
          <p>Buon appetito!</p>
